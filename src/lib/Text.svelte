    Hello! My name is Simon. I'm a computer science student and software
    engineer. I love programming, problem solving, and studying new and modern
    technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can design and develop maintainable and scalable web and mobile
    applications. I'm passionate about writing readable and clean code. That's
    why i put a lot of emphasis on refactoring.
  </p>
  <p>
    I strongly believe in documentation as it is fundamental to have a plan of
    the software that should be built, especially in a team. I'm also a team
    player, and find it very important to learn from and teach others.
